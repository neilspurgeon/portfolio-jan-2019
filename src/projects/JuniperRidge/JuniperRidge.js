        <p>After succesfully launching their mobile app, Hathway was overhaul The Coffee Bean & Tea Leafâ€™s ecommerce website experirence. This included a complete redesign of their existing shopping pages, aswell as additional storytelling, marketing, and company information pages.</p>
        <p>My role on the project was lead ux and ui design. Our process began with creating a comprehensive site map and then creating low fideltity wireframes of each page type. By doing this we were able to lock down content and overall structure before diving into full fidelty ui.</p>
