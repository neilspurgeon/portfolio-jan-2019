# Portfolio

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## How it works
Each project requires a data.js file to that stores standard project informations. This data.js file is then imported in to the the ```projects/index.js``` object array along with the project page component. This array gives us the ability to dynamically loop through all projects.

## What is being used?
- CSS Next syntax through postcss
- CSS Modules
- Waypoints for triggering scroll based animations
